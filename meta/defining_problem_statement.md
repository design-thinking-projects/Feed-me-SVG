## Problem Statement
Being a designer at my workplace, I find it repetitive and time consuming to generates image assets to be used in custom app solutions for clients. I wish there could be a way where **from a given image and specifications, whole range of image assets could be generated** and **in well organised folder structures.**

## Possible Solution
A webapp that is accessible within the organisation and by members with adeqaute permission level where they provide a source image, define the specifications of images to be generates and also the folder structures in which they are to be placed.

In MVP, specification can be hard-coded as it's unlikely to be changed in longterm. But in letter version, new specifications can be added and old ones can be accessed all through a feature called **'Specifications Library'** with this the tool/app will become more **general in nature.**
