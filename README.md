# Feed-me-SVG
**A web tool that feeds on SVG and shits PNG/JPG in apecifc dimensions configured by the user.**

This project is a solution to the problem the author faces in workplace, which is related to export of logo assets for Custom Apps. These logos are part of implementation requirement and are provided by designers. The assets are required by Implementation team to build app for all platforms (Android, iOS and Web) for the client.

## The Problem Statement.
The existing process is too manual. It requires an input image to be copy/paste manually on all the artboards in sketch file which are pre-configured as per requirements from targeted platform. Each artbaord is then exported into PNG(s) manually. In case of Android, another tool *Native Image Script Builder* is required to produce image assets in specific formats and directory structures to be able to use them in building the app.
